# Gravity-Games
When I was studying in the Netherlands one of my
assignments was to make a game using Phaser.js. We
had to come up with our own mechanics and graphics. I
created a game called Gravity Games in which the main
mechanic is gravity switching, where the player can
change the gravity to collect coins in difficult places. I 
received 90% for this assignment.
